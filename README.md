# Predicting Mobile App Churn Through Feature Usage Patterns

## Overview

This project analyzes user engagement data from a mobile application to predict user churn based on feature usage patterns.  The analysis aims to identify key features and usage behaviors that are strongly correlated with churn, allowing for the development of targeted retention strategies.  The project utilizes machine learning techniques to build predictive models and visualize the relationships between feature usage and churn.

## Technologies Used

* Python 3
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn

## How to Run

1. **Install Dependencies:**  Ensure you have Python 3 installed.  Then, navigate to the project directory in your terminal and install the required libraries using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Analysis:** Execute the main script using:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Example Output

The script will print key analysis results to the console, including summary statistics, model performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall), and feature importance scores.  Additionally, the script generates several visualization files (e.g., churn rate over time, feature usage distributions) in the `output` directory.  These visualizations help illustrate the relationships between feature usage and churn prediction.  The exact filenames and content of the output will depend on the data used and the specific analysis performed.


## Data

The project requires a dataset containing user feature usage data and a churn label (indicating whether a user churned or not).  The data should be in a suitable format (e.g., CSV).  For demonstration purposes, a sample dataset may be provided separately.
